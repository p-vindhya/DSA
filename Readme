coding data 
Omega, O and Theta are just notations. You could use Omega for worst case and O for best case. Example is that best case for linear search is O(1).

Thing is, that if given an algorithm A, if for example worst case is O(n) and best case is Omega(n), then u can use Theta to describe the exact complexity of the algorithm: Theta(n)
